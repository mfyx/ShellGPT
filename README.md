# ShellGPT

ShellGPT is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that integrates GPT assistance into a shell terminal. It is built on top of Python's `cmd` module and aims to enhance the user experience by providing intelligent suggestions and command completions.

## Usage 

ShellGPT provides the following base abilities:

- **Directory Navigation**: Easily change the current working directory using the `cd` command.
- **Exit Terminal**: Use the `exit` command to leave the ShellGPT terminal.
- **Command Highlighting**: Enhance user experience with command highlighting.
- **Launch External Command-Line Programs**: Support launching external command-line programs like `vim` by prefixing the command with "!", increasing tool flexibility.
